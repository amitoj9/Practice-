Declare your class final - 
Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense
Make the constructor private - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class
Make all the members and functions of the class static - 
Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed
